## Project Overview
This project showcases an asynchronous e-learning module designed as part of a blended English for Childcare course for adult English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) learners at CEFR A2–B1 (Common European Framewrk of Reference) level. The focus is Module 3: Healthy Eating for Families, developed as a standalone digital component that learners complete independently between live sessions. The module was built in Articulate Rise as a prototype to demonstrate instructional design, learning flow, and interaction design for employability-focused ESOL provision.

## Context & Audience
The target audience is adult learners of English at A2–B1 level on the CEFR who are interested in working with children in roles such as nanny, nursery assistant, or teaching assistant. Learners are predominantly women, including returning mothers, career changers, and migrant workers. Many study alongside caring responsibilities, rely heavily on smartphones, and experience variable Wi-Fi and mixed digital confidence. These factors informed a mobile-first design with clear structure, short activities, and strong language support. 

## Design Approach
The module follows a blended learning model, combining asynchronous self-paced study with tutor-led live sessions. The asynchronous element prepares learners with vocabulary, concepts, and confidence, while live sessions focus on discussion and application.
Module 3 was selected for full prototyping because the content is concrete, visual, and well suited to a complete micro-learning journey. The learning sequence moves from activation → input → practice → reflection, using predictable patterns to reduce cognitive load and support learners who are new to online study. Interactions were chosen to be simple, familiar, and reliable on smartphones, reflecting learners’ real access conditions such as small screens, variable Wi-Fi, and mixed digital confidence.

## Tools Used
- Articulate Rise (prototype authoring)
- Google Classroom (intended delivery context)
- Lightweight browser-based tools for interaction and feedback


## Delivery Note
While the prototype is built in Rise, the design is platform-agnostic. The learning flow and interactions can be implemented in institutionally supported VLEs (eg Google Classroom) or adapted for SCORM-compatible LMSs in other college contexts.

## What I’d Do Next
User testing with live cohorts, followed by iteration and rollout of additional modules using the same design pattern.
